Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science top-tier class at Beijing Institute of Technology. I was fortunate to have the oppotunity to study under Prof. Cheng-liang Chai, who is an excellent teacher, guiding me to the academemic path. 

My research interest includes Multi-Agents, Large Language Models, Database, Data Science, Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
